This

```typescript
 async handleCreateOrUpdateEvent(event: Event): Promise<CreationOrUpdateResult> {

        try{
            return this.handleEvent(event);
        }catch(e){
            console.log(e);
            return {
                result: "failure",
                errorData: {
                    channelMessage: e.message
                }
            }
        }
        
    }
```
and this

```typescript
 async handleCreateOrUpdateEvent(event: Event): Promise<CreationOrUpdateResult> {

        try{
            return await this.handleEvent(event);
        }catch(e){
            console.log(e);
            return {
                result: "failure",
                errorData: {
                    channelMessage: e.message
                }
            }
        }
        
    }
```

Are not behaving the same way. Have you spotted the difference?

I admit I encountered this a couple of times and this is a great sources of errors difficult to handle.

A try catch block is allowed on an async method only if the await are explicit.
So both ```return x;``` and ```return await x;``` are equivalent from the point of view of the method signature but in the first case it's not possible to implement a try catch block.

Of course, a potential solution would be to use ```catch()```
