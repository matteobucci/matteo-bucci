Python enviroments have  been created for a specific reason.
Same applies for node version manager. The challenges of working with multiple projects in your machine is always challening.

I love trying new projects and technologies but some of them are heavy on dependencies and the risk of having a machine slower to start, prone to break are real.
What solution then?

I found out that VS Code dev containers could be extactly what I need. I'm still not sure and my machine is already too bloated to try doing it but I would like to do it.

My dream goal would be to have a clean version of Linux always available to me. 
I don't want to rely on local files, but I want to assume that, within 10 minutes I will be able to recraete my perfect work enviroment and work on the projects I want.

So I think that I need to set me specific goals in two areas:
- My Linux machine configuration
- VSCode configuration

Would I reach my goal? I don't know, but in the meanwhile I've prepared this short paragraph to motivate me!


## October 2023

I'm writing this paragraph from my iPad PRO during a train trip. I know I could have used my pc, but for a short day-trip I didn't wanted to increase the weight to carry by more than two kilos.

I don't like small screens but I believe I've reached a flexibility similar to what I needed on this project.

Things I'm capable to do:
- Open an URL and start coding, indipendently from my device
- Editing and creating new files and component
- Run the project and compile files
- Test the result on a dedicated endpoint
- Commit, and see the changes reflected in real life
- Using many extensions I normally use, including copilot

Things I struggle doing
- Include pictures and other type of resources in the project. This is more a limitation of iOS more than anything else
- Writing whenever the connection is unstable

Things I still can't do
- Having a fullscreen editor (I need to deal with the address bar of the browser)
- Working on more complex project (ATM)

## How to do it?
My current setup is based on three main components:

*VS Code Web*
I coudln't belive the first time I saw it. It's an equivalent version to the desktop one. The limitations, of course, are coming from the fact that the app has no access to any file system.

*Github Codespaces*
This allow to have a virtual machine somewhere in the cloud running an instance of VSCode server, with your repository already loaded on it.
With such service, VSCode dev could easily connect to terminal of a Codespace instance and, any command or file changed is changed remotelly.

This is achievable also by installing a server instance on a VM and connect to that. I would like to try eventually but this setup is by far the fastest achievable.

Whenever we need to access something that is running on the development server (on localhost), thanks to port forwarding we can access a tunnel on a public URL that act exactly how localhost would do locally.

*Web containers*
Another VSCode feature, uses a file definition to build your dev enviroment from a docker container.
Let's say that I'm working on two different projects with very different enviroments. One is a NodeJS project and the other one is a Python one.

I could associate to one project a container built for python development and to the other one a container build for node development.

Furthermore, we could associate as well info about the extensions that are required, preliminary commands or dependencies to install and more.

This allow a real one-click experience for any dev that wants to get up and running on a project.

By using the webcontainer associated with this project, for instance, there is not even the need to run 'npm install' because it's done automatically when starting the container.

Codespaces supports webcontainer as well.

This is an example of my current devcontainer

```
// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/typescript-node
{
	"name": "Node.js & TypeScript",
	// Or use a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file. More info: https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:1-20-bullseye",

	// Features to add to the dev container. More info: https://containers.dev/features.
	// "features": {},

	// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	// "forwardPorts": [],

	// Use 'postCreateCommand' to run commands after the container is created.
	"postCreateCommand": "npm install -g gatsby && npm install"

	// Configure tool-specific properties.
	// "customizations": {},

	// Uncomment to connect as root instead. More info: https://aka.ms/dev-containers-non-root.
	// "remoteUser": "root"
}
