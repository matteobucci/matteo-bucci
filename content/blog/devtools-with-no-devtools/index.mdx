Python enviroments have  been created for a specific reason.
Same applies for node version manager. The challenges of working with multiple projects in your machine is always challening.

I love trying new projects and technologies but some of them are heavy on dependencies and the risk of having a machine slower to start, prone to break are real.
What solution then?

I found out that VS Code dev containers could be extactly what I need. I'm still not sure and my machine is already too bloated to try doing it but I would like to do it.

My dream goal would be to have a clean version of Linux always available to me. 
I don't want to rely on local files, but I want to assume that, within 10 minutes I will be able to recraete my perfect work enviroment and work on the projects I want.

So I think that I need to set me specific goals in two areas:
- My Linux machine configuration
- VSCode configuration

Would I reach my goal? I don't know, but in the meanwhile I've prepared this short paragraph to motivate me!
