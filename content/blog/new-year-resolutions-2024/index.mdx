2024 will surely be one of the years where I can't find excuses for not making New Year's resolutions. Thankfully, as far as I am aware, there is no correlation between setting goals at the beginning of the year and actually achieving them. The truth, as I've been told, is that having clear goals in mind is an important part of reaching them, not the time of year when they are set.

This 2024 is already promising a lot of change ahead, so I want to be clear about the areas I would like to improve this year.

Professionally speaking, I am planning to be emotionally mature in facing all the professional challenges that come my way. This breaks one of my favorite attributes of certain goals, which is having a clear definition of what success looks like. Still, the environment I will find myself in next year will offer enough growth opportunities for those with the energy to embrace them. I plan to be less influenced by what I can't control. Instead of losing focus, I could channel my energies into something more productive. 2023 taught me that optimizations fall short when emotions are involved, and productivity must be measured over timelines longer than our day-to-day troubles.

On the personal side of things, my goal needs to be: deliver! Using a term I use professionally is intentional: the lack of deadlines or milestones helps in exploring more, but also prevents spending the necessary time to finalize things. This website is a clear example of that. More than deadlines, I believe involving more people in what I do and being more involved in what others do could be helpful. Again, this website should be seen as a way of doing this :)

This is the first year I'm writing anything like this, but hopefully, next year I will have some notes to compare with my new New Year's resolutions. Still, if I remember correctly, I failed last year's ones, but that doesn't mean 2023 lacked fun and personal growth. I guess there's a lesson in that too.
