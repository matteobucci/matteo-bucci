I don't know how to make the euro symbol on Fedora Linux and international layout. I tried at least a couple of times and made a couple of researchs with no success.
Update: Windows Key, Typing Euro in the search bar, Enter. That copy the euro sign!



I don't know how to access global python packages just installed with pip. I have an idea on how to do that, but honestly I'd rather create a new virtual enviroment.
Update: I need global package on a recent project, I managed to make them work but I'm still not sure on how I achieve them!
