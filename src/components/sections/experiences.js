      <h3>Serverless systems</h3>

      <p>
        I'm confortable on designing high-scalable, high-performance system
        leveraging cloud resources in serverless enviroment. I implemented
        several complex use cases that could be scaled horizontally with the use
        of a mix of designs and asyncronous systems.
      </p>

      <h3>Hybrid architectures</h3>

      <p>
        Microservices or monolith? Event driven or not? Some systems simply
        needs to make the best use of each. I've got experience on taking
        decision depending on the benefits of each architecture style.
      </p>

      <h3>Continous deployment</h3>

      <p>
        Tools are like superpowers that can help you focus on the value added
        part of my activities. I've got experience on setting up CI/CD pipelines
        to automate the deployment of my projects, because if there's no need to
        write any code twice, why should I deploy it twice? I've worked with
        several CI/CD tools like Github Actions and Google Cloud Build.
      </p>

      <h3>Product analytics</h3>
      <p>
        Metrics are a fundamental part of every product. I've got experience on
        designing and implementing metrics and analytics systems to track the
        usage of a product and its features.
      </p>

      <h3>Product development</h3>

      <p>
        I've developed and designed B2B and B2C products starting from the
        business and design requirements. My experiences brought me a set of
        horizontal skills in this fields, that are helping me on evaluating the
        challenges behind the creation of a product from scratch. I've got
        experience in digital marketing, SEO, customer support, sales and on how
        to organize parties :)
